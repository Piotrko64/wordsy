# About 

### Why I created this app?
Sometimes I reading articles or watching videos in English languages. Sometimes I meet word that I don't know and I would like learn this new word and repeat from time to time for better memory. Wordsy resolve this problem! You can add any word and example sentence! Next You can using a several modes to better learning this!
<br />
Wordsy have approximately 100 words of my authority and a big base of other simple words to learn. If you are Pole and you would like exercise your english** Wordsy is for you!**

### Wordsy actually have a 7 modes! For example flashcards mode or screensaver mode!

This mode is good if you doing something but from time to time would like look at computer monitor

<br />

Main page have also other section for example - word of the day (SÅ‚owo dnia)

## You can add own words and using my words ;)

This is list of your every word on **Wordsy**


### Attention!

Wordsy don't use any database to storage your words! Your own words will be sorage in local storage. However, You can create backup by JSON file. This was my individual decision (I wanted create app without any login system).  


# PWA

You can install Wordsy as a mobile app (Progressive web aplication). This also mean that you can use this app offline! I think this is awesome!
Thanks **Vite** for greatful functions for PWA! 


<br />

# Future

In the future I would like add more tests for Wordsy and add more my own words on start.

P.S. When I write this documentation I feel a litle confusion because I writing this documentation in english but App is for Poles! ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
